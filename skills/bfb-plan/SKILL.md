# /bfb-plan

Tahap **PLAN** dalam siklus bfb (`/bfb-prepare` → `/bfb-observe` → `/bfb-spec` → `/bfb-plan` → `/bfb-build` → `/bfb-test` → `/bfb-review` → `/bfb-ship` → `/bfb-prepare` → `/bfb-commit`).

Baca `architecture/SPEC.md` bila ada, `architecture/OBSERVE.md` untuk alur browser (setiap kondisi di peta kondisinya harus punya task yang menanganinya), `AGENTS.md`, dan kode yang relevan (mulai dari `graphify query`, bukan grep). Lalu:

1. Masuk plan mode: hanya membaca, tanpa mengubah kode.
2. Petakan dependensi antar komponen (`commands/` → `core/` → `libs/`).
3. Iris pekerjaan secara vertikal, satu jalur utuh per task, bukan per lapisan.
4. Tulis task dengan acceptance criteria dan langkah verifikasi.
5. Tambahkan checkpoint antar fase.
6. Presentasikan rencana untuk direview user.

Simpan rencana dan daftar task-nya di `architecture/PLAN.md`. Pisahkan dari `TODO.md` di root, yang mencatat temuan audit dan keputusan terbuka, bukan rencana kerja. Kalau `architecture/PLAN.md` masih punya task yang belum selesai untuk pekerjaan lain, berhenti dan tanya sebelum menimpanya.

Langkah verifikasi setiap task harus berupa perintah yang benar-benar ada di repo ini: `bun run test` (`bun run test:coverage` untuk ambang 100%), `bun run type-check`, `bun run lint`, `bun run check`. Task yang menyentuh `core/*` (butuh Chrome dan akun sungguhan) harus menyebut langkah cek manualnya secara eksplisit, dan logika murninya sebisa mungkin dipindah ke `libs/` supaya bisa dites.

# Method

Prosedur di bawah di-vendor dari `addyosmani/agent-skills` (`skills/planning-and-task-breakdown`) pada commit `2686b62`. Bagian bfb di atas menang setiap kali keduanya bertentangan — termasuk lokasi file: `architecture/PLAN.md`, bukan `tasks/plan.md` atau `tasks/todo.md`.

## Planning and Task Breakdown

### Overview

Decompose work into small, verifiable tasks with explicit acceptance criteria. Good task breakdown is the difference between an agent that completes work reliably and one that produces a tangled mess. Every task should be small enough to implement, test, and verify in a single focused session.

### When to Use

- You have a spec and need to break it into implementable units
- A task feels too large or vague to start
- Work needs to be parallelized across multiple agents or sessions
- You need to communicate scope to a human
- The implementation order isn't obvious

**When NOT to use:** Single-file changes with obvious scope, or when the spec already contains well-defined tasks.

### The Planning Process

#### Step 1: Enter Plan Mode

Before writing any code, operate in read-only mode:

- Read the spec and relevant codebase sections
- Identify existing patterns and conventions
- Map dependencies between components
- Note risks and unknowns

**Do NOT write code during planning.** The output is a plan document saved to `tasks/plan.md` and a task list recorded in the task list target (see Output Files; default `tasks/todo.md`), not implementation.

#### Step 2: Identify the Dependency Graph

Map what depends on what:

```
Database schema
    │
    ├── API models/types
    │       │
    │       ├── API endpoints
    │       │       │
    │       │       └── Frontend API client
    │       │               │
    │       │               └── UI components
    │       │
    │       └── Validation logic
    │
    └── Seed data / migrations
```

Implementation order follows the dependency graph bottom-up: build foundations first.

#### Step 3: Slice Vertically

Instead of building all the database, then all the API, then all the UI — build one complete feature path at a time:

**Bad (horizontal slicing):**

```
Task 1: Build entire database schema
Task 2: Build all API endpoints
Task 3: Build all UI components
Task 4: Connect everything
```

**Good (vertical slicing):**

```
Task 1: User can create an account (schema + API + UI for registration)
Task 2: User can log in (auth schema + API + UI for login)
Task 3: User can create a task (task schema + API + UI for creation)
Task 4: User can view task list (query + API + UI for list view)
```

Each vertical slice delivers working, testable functionality.

#### Step 4: Write Tasks

Each task follows this structure, whether it lands in the markdown task list or as an item in an external tracker (see Output Files):

```markdown
## Task [N]: [Short descriptive title]

**Description:** One paragraph explaining what this task accomplishes.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] [Specific, testable condition]
- [ ] [Specific, testable condition]

**Verification:**

- [ ] Tests pass: [the repository's focused-test command]
- [ ] Build succeeds: [the repository's build command]
- [ ] Manual check: [description of what to verify]

**Dependencies:** [Task numbers this depends on, or "None"]

**Files likely touched:**

- `src/path/to/file.ts`
- `tests/path/to/test.ts`

**Estimated scope:** [Small: 1-2 files | Medium: 3-5 files | Large: 5+ files]
```

#### Step 5: Order and Checkpoint

Arrange tasks so that:

1. Dependencies are satisfied (build foundation first)
2. Each task leaves the system in a working state
3. Verification checkpoints occur after every 2-3 tasks
4. High-risk tasks are early (fail fast)

Add explicit checkpoints to the task list target:

```markdown
## Checkpoint: After Tasks 1-3

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Application builds without errors
- [ ] Core user flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Review with human before proceeding
```

### Task Sizing Guidelines

| Size   | Files | Scope                                 | Example                              |
| ------ | ----- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **XS** | 1     | Single function or config change      | Add a validation rule                |
| **S**  | 1-2   | One component or endpoint             | Add a new API endpoint               |
| **M**  | 3-5   | One feature slice                     | User registration flow               |
| **L**  | 5-8   | Multi-component feature               | Search with filtering and pagination |
| **XL** | 8+    | **Too large — break it down further** | —                                    |

If a task is L or larger, it should be broken into smaller tasks. An agent performs best on S and M tasks.

**When to break a task down further:**

- It would take more than one focused session (roughly 2+ hours of agent work)
- You cannot describe the acceptance criteria in 3 or fewer bullet points
- It touches two or more independent subsystems (e.g., auth and billing)
- You find yourself writing "and" in the task title (a sign it is two tasks)

### Output Files

- **Plan document:** Save the implementation plan to `tasks/plan.md`. This is always a markdown file — design decisions, risks, and open questions don't map cleanly onto individual tracker issues.
- **Task list:** Record each task in the **task list target** (defined below).

Create the `tasks/` directory if it does not exist.

**Never overwrite an incomplete plan.** Before writing `tasks/plan.md` or `tasks/todo.md`, check whether they already exist and still contain unchecked tasks:

- Same work being replanned (the user asked to revise or extend this plan) → update the existing files in place.
- Different work → **stop and ask.** The unchecked tasks may be mid-build in another session. Do not delete, overwrite, or rename the existing files on your own; present the conflict and let the user decide (finish the old plan first, explicitly discard it, or tell you where the new plan should go).

The same rule applies to an external task list target: never bulk-close or delete another plan's open tracker items to make room for new ones.

#### Task List Target

The task list target is where tasks and checkpoints are recorded. It is defined once, here; every other reference in this skill defers to it.

- **Default: a checklist-style markdown file at `tasks/todo.md`.** This is the convention the `/build` command and other downstream tooling expect. Use it unless the project says otherwise.
- **External tracker:** if the project's agent rules (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) or the user designate an issue tracker (e.g. GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear, `bd`/beads), create one tracker item per task instead of writing `tasks/todo.md`. Map the Step 4 structure onto the tracker's fields: acceptance criteria and verification steps in the item body, dependencies via the tracker's linking mechanism (`bd dep add`, "blocked by", etc.). Record Step 5 checkpoints as tracker items too, or as a checklist in the plan document if the tracker has no natural equivalent.

When using an external tracker, note it in `tasks/plan.md` (e.g. "Tasks tracked in Linear project FOO") so downstream steps and future sessions know where to look, and keep the plan document's Task List section as an ordered index of tracker item IDs or links rather than a duplicate checklist.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk   | Impact         | Mitigation |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------- |
| [Risk] | [High/Med/Low] | [Strategy] |

## Open Questions

- [Question needing human input]
```

When tasks live in an external tracker, keep the Task List section above as an ordered index of tracker item IDs or links instead of a duplicate checklist.

### Parallelization Opportunities

When multiple agents or sessions are available:

- **Safe to parallelize:** Independent feature slices, tests for already-implemented features, documentation
- **Must be sequential:** Database migrations, shared state changes, dependency chains
- **Needs coordination:** Features that share an API contract (define the contract first, then parallelize)

### Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization                                          | Reality                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'll figure it out as I go"                             | That's how you end up with a tangled mess and rework. 10 minutes of planning saves hours.                                         |
| "The tasks are obvious"                                  | Write them down anyway. Explicit tasks surface hidden dependencies and forgotten edge cases.                                      |
| "Planning is overhead"                                   | Planning is the task. Implementation without a plan is just typing.                                                               |
| "I can hold it all in my head"                           | Context windows are finite. Written plans survive session boundaries and compaction.                                              |
| "The old `tasks/plan.md` is stale, I'll just replace it" | Unchecked tasks may be mid-build in another session. Overwriting them destroys work state that exists nowhere else. Stop and ask. |

### Red Flags

- Starting implementation without a written task list
- Overwriting a `tasks/plan.md` or `tasks/todo.md` that still has unchecked tasks for different work, without asking
- Writing `tasks/todo.md` when the project has designated an external tracker (or scattering tasks across both)
- Tasks that say "implement the feature" without acceptance criteria
- No verification steps in the plan
- All tasks are XL-sized
- No checkpoints between tasks
- Dependency order isn't considered

### Verification

Before starting implementation, confirm:

- [ ] Every task has acceptance criteria
- [ ] Every task has a verification step
- [ ] Task dependencies are identified and ordered correctly
- [ ] Tasks are recorded in the task list target (default `tasks/todo.md`)
- [ ] No pre-existing incomplete plan was overwritten without explicit user confirmation
- [ ] No task touches more than ~5 files
- [ ] Checkpoints exist between major phases
- [ ] The human has reviewed and approved the plan

### See Also

Acceptance criteria are per-task and answer "did we build the right thing?". They sit on top of the project-wide Definition of Done, the standing bar every task clears before it counts as done. See the **Definition of Done** section under "Reference" at the end of this file.

# Reference

## Definition of Done

A standing, project-wide bar that every change must clear before it counts as done. Unlike acceptance criteria, which vary per task and answer "did we build the right thing?", the Definition of Done is the same every time and answers "is this finished to our standard?". Use it as the final gate in `planning-and-task-breakdown`, `incremental-implementation`, and `shipping-and-launch`.

### Definition of Done vs. Acceptance Criteria

|         | Acceptance Criteria                      | Definition of Done                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Scope   | Specific to one task or spec             | Applies to every increment                 |
| Changes | Different for each item                  | Fixed and reused                           |
| Answers | "Did we build _this thing_?"             | "Is it _ready_?"                           |
| Owner   | Defined when planning the task           | Defined once for the project               |
| Example | "User can reset password via email link" | "Tests pass, no regressions, docs updated" |

The two are complementary. A task is done only when **its** acceptance criteria are met **and** the standing Definition of Done is satisfied. Skipping either leaves work that looks finished but is not.

### The Standing Checklist

Apply this to every change before declaring it done.

#### Correctness

- [ ] All acceptance criteria for the task are met
- [ ] Code runs and behaves as intended, verified at runtime, not just compiled or typechecked
- [ ] New behavior is covered by tests that fail without the change and pass with it
- [ ] Existing tests still pass; no regressions introduced
- [ ] Edge cases and error paths are handled, not just the happy path

#### Quality

- [ ] Code reveals intent through naming and structure; no comments needed to explain _what_ it does
- [ ] No duplicated business logic
- [ ] No dead code, debug output, or commented-out blocks left behind
- [ ] Changes are scoped to the task; no unrelated refactors snuck in
- [ ] Linting and formatting pass

The depth behind these items lives in `code-review-and-quality` (the five-axis review) and `code-simplification` (reducing complexity without changing behavior).

#### Integration

- [ ] Change works with the rest of the system, not just in isolation
- [ ] Database migrations, config changes, and feature flags are accounted for
- [ ] Backward compatibility considered for any public interface or API change

#### Documentation

- [ ] Public interfaces, APIs, and user-facing behavior are documented
- [ ] Architectural decisions worth preserving are recorded (see `documentation-and-adrs`)
- [ ] Documentation describes the current state in timeless language, not the change history

#### Ship-readiness

- [ ] Security implications reviewed for any untrusted input, auth, or data handling (see `security-and-hardening`)
- [ ] Observability in place for new critical paths (logs, metrics, traces) (see `observability-and-instrumentation`)
- [ ] Rollback path exists for anything risky (see `shipping-and-launch`)
- [ ] The human has reviewed and approved before merge or deploy

### How to Apply

- **Per task**: confirm the Correctness and Quality sections before checking the task off.
- **Per feature**: confirm Integration and Documentation before considering the feature complete.
- **Per release**: the full checklist is the floor; `shipping-and-launch` adds the deploy-specific gates on top.

Tailor the list to the project once, then reuse it unchanged. A Definition of Done that is renegotiated every sprint is not a Definition of Done.

### Red Flags

- "It's done, I just haven't run it yet": unverified work is not done.
- "Tests pass" used as a synonym for done while docs, regressions, or runtime verification are skipped.
- A different bar applied depending on deadline pressure.
- Acceptance criteria treated as the whole bar, with no standing quality floor.
- "Done" declared before human review on changes that need it.
