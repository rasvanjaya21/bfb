# /bfb-review

Tahap **REVIEW** dalam siklus bfb (`/bfb-prepare` → `/bfb-observe` → `/bfb-spec` → `/bfb-plan` → `/bfb-build` → `/bfb-test` → `/bfb-review` → `/bfb-ship` → `/bfb-prepare` → `/bfb-commit`).

Review perubahan yang di-stage atau commit terakhir di lima sumbu:

1. **Correctness.** Sesuai `architecture/SPEC.md`, edge case tertangani, test memadai.
2. **Readability.** Nama jelas, logika lurus, organisasi masuk akal.
3. **Architecture.** Mengikuti pola yang ada (`commands/` → `core/` → `libs/`), batas bersih, abstraksi pas.
4. **Security.** Input divalidasi, secret aman, tidak ada kredensial yang dicatat ke log.
5. **Performance.** Tidak ada kerja tanpa batas, tidak ada request jaringan berulang tanpa perlu.

Kategorikan temuan sebagai Critical, Important, atau Suggestion, masing-masing dengan referensi `file:line` dan perbaikan konkret. Tulis laporannya ke `architecture/REVIEW.md`, menggantikan laporan sebelumnya. Temuan yang tidak diperbaiki masuk ke `TODO.md`, jangan terkubur di laporan.

## Yang wajib dicek, yang terlewat oleh review generik

- Import relatif (`./`, `../`, `import('./x')`) — harus lewat alias `@/`.
- Loop browser di `core/*` yang tidak lewat `runBrowserRows()`, sehingga context tidak dipisah per baris dan cookie atau storage satu akun bocor ke baris berikutnya (konten terposting ke akun yang salah).
- `process.exit` baru di dalam `core/*`, atau error yang ditelan tanpa pesan.
- Password, cookie, atau token yang tercetak ke console, atau ditulis tanpa permission `0o600`.
- Header CSV yang tidak cocok dengan interface di `src/types/global.ts`.
- Teks untuk user yang bukan Bahasa Indonesia atau keluar dari pola menu.
- Dependency runtime baru yang tidak masuk `external` di `bunup.config.ts`.
- `VERSION` di `src/utils/constant.ts` yang tidak sama dengan `package.json`.
- Klaim di `AGENTS.md` atau skill yang baru saja dibuat salah oleh perubahan ini.

## Code Review and Quality

### Overview

Multi-dimensional code review with quality gates. Every change gets reviewed before merge — no exceptions. Review covers five axes: correctness, readability, architecture, security, and performance.

**The approval standard:** Approve a change when it definitely improves overall code health, even if it isn't perfect. Perfect code doesn't exist — the goal is continuous improvement. Don't block a change because it isn't exactly how you would have written it. If it improves the codebase and follows the project's conventions, approve it.

### When to Use

- Before merging any PR or change
- After completing a feature implementation
- When another agent or model produced code you need to evaluate
- When refactoring existing code
- After any bug fix (review both the fix and the regression test)

### The Five-Axis Review

Every review evaluates code across these dimensions:

#### 1. Correctness

Does the code do what it claims to do?

- Does it match the spec or task requirements?
- Are edge cases handled (null, empty, boundary values)?
- Are error paths handled (not just the happy path)?
- Does it pass all tests? Are the tests actually testing the right things?
- Are there off-by-one errors, race conditions, or state inconsistencies?

#### 2. Readability & Simplicity

Can another engineer (or agent) understand this code without the author explaining it?

- Are names descriptive and consistent with project conventions? (No `temp`, `data`, `result` without context)
- Is the control flow straightforward (avoid nested ternaries, deep callbacks)?
- Is the code organized logically (related code grouped, clear module boundaries)?
- Are there any "clever" tricks that should be simplified?
- **Could this be done in fewer lines?** (1000 lines where 100 suffice is a failure)
- **Are abstractions earning their complexity?** (Don't generalize until the third use case)
- Would comments help clarify non-obvious intent? (But don't comment obvious code.)
- Are there dead code artifacts: no-op variables (`_unused`), backwards-compat shims, or `// removed` comments?
- **Is a new conditional bolted onto an unrelated flow?** That's a design smell, not a nit — push the logic into its own helper, state, or policy instead of tangling an existing path.
- **Do repeated conditionals on the same shape appear?** They signal a missing model or dispatcher. A "temporary" branch is usually permanent debt.

#### 3. Architecture

Does the change fit the system's design?

- Does it follow existing patterns or introduce a new one? If new, is it justified?
- Does it maintain clean module boundaries?
- Is there code duplication that should be shared?
- Are dependencies flowing in the right direction (no circular dependencies)?
- Is the abstraction level appropriate (not over-engineered, not too coupled)?
- **Does this refactor reduce complexity or just relocate it?** Count the concepts a reader must hold to follow the change. If a "cleaner" version leaves that count unchanged, it isn't cleaner — prefer the restructuring that makes whole branches, modes, or layers disappear over one that re-centralizes the same logic. Prefer deleting an abstraction to polishing it.
- **Is feature-specific logic leaking into a shared or general-purpose module?** Keep logic in its owning layer, reuse the existing canonical helper instead of a near-duplicate, and don't normalize architectural drift.
- **Are type boundaries explicit?** Question gratuitous `any`/`unknown`/optional/casts and silent fallbacks that paper over an unclear invariant — making the boundary explicit often makes the surrounding control flow simpler.

#### 4. Security

For detailed security guidance, see `security-and-hardening`. Does the change introduce vulnerabilities?

- Is user input validated and sanitized?
- Are secrets kept out of code, logs, and version control?
- Is authentication/authorization checked where needed?
- Are SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation)?
- Are outputs encoded to prevent XSS?
- Are dependencies from trusted sources with no known vulnerabilities?
- Is data from external sources (APIs, logs, user content, config files) treated as untrusted?
- Are external data flows validated at system boundaries before use in logic or rendering?

#### 5. Performance

For detailed profiling and optimization, see `performance-optimization`. Does the change introduce performance problems?

- Any N+1 query patterns?
- Any unbounded loops or unconstrained data fetching?
- Any synchronous operations that should be async?
- Any unnecessary re-renders in UI components?
- Any missing pagination on list endpoints?
- Any large objects created in hot paths?

### Structural Remedies

When you flag a structural problem, propose the move — not just the problem. A review that only says "this is complex" leaves the author guessing. Reach for a named restructuring:

- **Replace a chain of conditionals** with a typed model or an explicit dispatcher.
- **Collapse duplicate branches** into a single clearer flow.
- **Separate orchestration from business logic** so each reads on its own.
- **Move feature-specific logic** out of a shared module into the package that owns the concept.
- **Reuse the canonical helper** instead of a bespoke near-duplicate.
- **Make a type boundary explicit** so downstream branching disappears.
- **Delete a pass-through wrapper** that adds indirection without clarifying the API.
- **Extract a helper, or split a large file** into focused modules.

Prefer the remedy that removes moving pieces over one that spreads the same complexity around.

### Change Sizing

Small, focused changes are easier to review, faster to merge, and safer to deploy. Target these sizes:

```
~100 lines changed   → Good. Reviewable in one sitting.
~300 lines changed   → Acceptable if it's a single logical change.
~1000 lines changed  → Too large. Split it.
```

**Watch file size, not just diff size.** A small diff can still push a file past a healthy boundary — around 1000 _total_ lines in a single file (distinct from the ~1000 _changed_-lines threshold above) is a common inspection signal, not a hard cap. When a change materially grows an already-large file, ask whether to extract helpers, subcomponents, or modules _first_, before piling more on. Decompose, then add.

**What counts as "one change":** A single self-contained modification that addresses one thing, includes related tests, and keeps the system functional after submission. One part of a feature — not the whole feature.

**Splitting strategies when a change is too large:**

| Strategy          | How                                                     | When                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Stack**         | Submit a small change, start the next one based on it   | Sequential dependencies |
| **By file group** | Separate changes for groups needing different reviewers | Cross-cutting concerns  |
| **Horizontal**    | Create shared code/stubs first, then consumers          | Layered architecture    |
| **Vertical**      | Break into smaller full-stack slices of the feature     | Feature work            |

**When large changes are acceptable:** Complete file deletions and automated refactoring where the reviewer only needs to verify intent, not every line.

**Separate refactoring from feature work.** A change that refactors existing code and adds new behavior is two changes — submit them separately. Small cleanups (variable renaming) can be included at reviewer discretion.

### Change Descriptions

Every change needs a description that stands alone in version control history.

**First line:** Short, imperative, standalone. "Delete the FizzBuzz RPC" not "Deleting the FizzBuzz RPC." Must be informative enough that someone searching history can understand the change without reading the diff.

**Body:** What is changing and why. Include context, decisions, and reasoning not visible in the code itself. Link to bug numbers, benchmark results, or design docs where relevant. Acknowledge approach shortcomings when they exist.

**Anti-patterns:** "Fix bug," "Fix build," "Add patch," "Moving code from A to B," "Phase 1," "Add convenience functions."

### Review Process

#### Step 1: Understand the Context

Before looking at code, understand the intent:

```
- What is this change trying to accomplish?
- What spec or task does it implement?
- What is the expected behavior change?
```

#### Step 2: Review the Tests First

Tests reveal intent and coverage:

```
- Do tests exist for the change?
- Do they test behavior (not implementation details)?
- Are edge cases covered?
- Do tests have descriptive names?
- Would the tests catch a regression if the code changed?
```

#### Step 3: Review the Implementation

Walk through the code with the five axes in mind:

```
For each file changed:
1. Correctness: Does this code do what the test says it should?
2. Readability: Can I understand this without help?
3. Architecture: Does this fit the system?
4. Security: Any vulnerabilities?
5. Performance: Any bottlenecks?
```

#### Step 4: Categorize Findings

Label every comment with its severity so the author knows what's required vs optional:

| Prefix                        | Meaning            | Author Action                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| _(no prefix)_                 | Required change    | Must address before merge                               |
| **Critical:**                 | Blocks merge       | Security vulnerability, data loss, broken functionality |
| **Nit:**                      | Minor, optional    | Author may ignore — formatting, style preferences       |
| **Optional:** / **Consider:** | Suggestion         | Worth considering but not required                      |
| **FYI**                       | Informational only | No action needed — context for future reference         |

This prevents authors from treating all feedback as mandatory and wasting time on optional suggestions.

**Lead with what matters.** Order findings by leverage: correctness and security first, then structural regressions and missed simplifications, then everything else. Don't bury a real issue under cosmetic nits — a few high-conviction comments beat a long list. If you have one structural problem and ten nits, the structural problem _is_ the review.

#### Step 5: Verify the Verification

Check the author's verification story:

```
- What tests were run?
- Did the build pass?
- Was the change tested manually?
- Are there screenshots for UI changes?
- Is there a before/after comparison?
```

### Multi-Model Review Pattern

Use different models for different review perspectives:

```
Model A writes the code
    │
    ▼
Model B reviews for correctness and architecture
    │
    ▼
Model A addresses the feedback
    │
    ▼
Human makes the final call
```

This catches issues that a single model might miss — different models have different blind spots.

**Example prompt for a review agent:**

```
Review this code change for correctness, security, and adherence to
our project conventions. The spec says [X]. The change should [Y].
Flag any issues as Critical, Required, Optional, or Nit.
```

### Dead Code Hygiene

After any refactoring or implementation change, check for orphaned code:

1. Identify code that is now unreachable or unused
2. List it explicitly
3. **Ask before deleting:** "Should I remove these now-unused elements: [list]?"

Don't leave dead code lying around — it confuses future readers and agents. But don't silently delete things you're not sure about. When in doubt, ask.

```
DEAD CODE IDENTIFIED:
- formatLegacyDate() in src/utils/date.ts — replaced by formatDate()
- OldTaskCard component in src/components/ — replaced by TaskCard
- LEGACY_API_URL constant in src/config.ts — no remaining references
→ Safe to remove these?
```

### Review Speed

Slow reviews block entire teams. The cost of context-switching to review is less than the waiting cost imposed on others.

- **Respond within one business day** — this is the maximum, not the target
- **Ideal cadence:** Respond shortly after a review request arrives, unless deep in focused coding. A typical change should complete multiple review rounds in a single day
- **Prioritize fast individual responses** over quick final approval. Quick feedback reduces frustration even if multiple rounds are needed
- **Large changes:** Ask the author to split them rather than reviewing one massive changeset

### Handling Disagreements

When resolving review disputes, apply this hierarchy:

1. **Technical facts and data** override opinions and preferences
2. **Style guides** are the absolute authority on style matters
3. **Software design** must be evaluated on engineering principles, not personal preference
4. **Codebase consistency** is acceptable if it doesn't degrade overall health

**Don't accept "I'll clean it up later."** Experience shows deferred cleanup rarely happens. Require cleanup before submission unless it's a genuine emergency. If surrounding issues can't be addressed in this change, require filing a bug with self-assignment.

### Honesty in Review

When reviewing code — whether written by you, another agent, or a human:

- **Don't rubber-stamp.** "LGTM" without evidence of review helps no one.
- **Don't soften real issues.** "This might be a minor concern" when it's a bug that will hit production is dishonest.
- **Quantify problems when possible.** "This N+1 query will add ~50ms per item in the list" is better than "this could be slow."
- **Push back on approaches with clear problems.** Sycophancy is a failure mode in reviews. If the implementation has issues, say so directly and propose alternatives.
- **Accept override gracefully.** If the author has full context and disagrees, defer to their judgment. Comment on code, not people — reframe personal critiques to focus on the code itself.

### Dependency Discipline

Part of code review is dependency review:

**Before adding any dependency:**

1. Does the existing stack solve this? (Often it does.)
2. How large is the dependency? (Check bundle impact.)
3. Is it actively maintained? (Check last commit, open issues.)
4. Does it have known vulnerabilities? (`npm audit`)
5. What's the license? (Must be compatible with the project.)

**Rule:** Prefer standard library and existing utilities over new dependencies. Every dependency is a liability.

**Upgrading an existing dependency** is a code change like any other, and the riskiest upgrades are the ones merged in bulk with a message like "bump deps." Review them with the same discipline:

1. **Read the changelog, not just the version number.** Semver is a promise the maintainer may not have kept — a "patch" can carry a behavioral change. For a major bump, read the migration notes and find what breaks.
2. **One dependency per change.** Upgrade and merge them individually (or in small related groups). When a bulk bump breaks the build, you've lost which package did it; a single-package change makes the cause obvious and the revert clean.
3. **Let the tests decide.** The upgrade is verified by a green suite before _and_ after, not by "it installed." If coverage around the dependency's behavior is thin, that gap is the real finding — add a test first.
4. **Mind the transitive graph.** Most installed packages are ones nobody chose directly. Review the lockfile diff, not just `package.json`; a single direct bump can pull in dozens of indirect changes.
5. **Keep the lockfile honest.** Commit it, review its diff, and never hand-edit it. The lockfile is the thing that actually pins what ships.

For triaging `npm audit` findings and supply-chain risk (typosquatting, compromised maintainers), follow the `security-and-hardening` skill — this section covers the upgrade _workflow_, that one covers the security verdict.

### Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization                                  | Reality                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "It works, that's good enough"                   | Working code that's unreadable, insecure, or architecturally wrong creates debt that compounds.                                                                               |
| "I wrote it, so I know it's correct"             | Authors are blind to their own assumptions. Every change benefits from another set of eyes.                                                                                   |
| "We'll clean it up later"                        | Later never comes. The review is the quality gate — use it. Require cleanup before merge, not after.                                                                          |
| "AI-generated code is probably fine"             | AI code needs more scrutiny, not less. It's confident and plausible, even when wrong.                                                                                         |
| "The tests pass, so it's good"                   | Tests are necessary but not sufficient. They don't catch architecture problems, security issues, or readability concerns.                                                     |
| "The refactor makes it cleaner"                  | Relocating complexity isn't reducing it. If the reader still holds the same number of concepts, the structure didn't improve — look for the version where branches disappear. |
| "It's only a small addition to this file"        | Small diffs still push files past a healthy size and bolt branches onto unrelated flows. Judge the resulting structure, not the diff size.                                    |
| "It's just a version bump"                       | A bump is a behavior change you didn't write. Read the changelog; semver doesn't guarantee no breakage.                                                                       |
| "I'll upgrade everything in one PR to save time" | A bulk bump that breaks the build hides which package did it. One dependency per change keeps the cause and the revert clean.                                                 |

### Red Flags

- PRs merged without any review
- Review that only checks if tests pass (ignoring other axes)
- "LGTM" without evidence of actual review
- Security-sensitive changes without security-focused review
- Large PRs that are "too big to review properly" (split them)
- No regression tests with bug fix PRs
- Review comments without severity labels — makes it unclear what's required vs optional
- Accepting "I'll fix it later" — it never happens
- A refactor that moves code around without reducing the number of concepts a reader must hold
- A change that grows an already-large file instead of decomposing it
- New conditionals scattered into unrelated code paths (a missing abstraction)
- A bespoke helper that duplicates an existing canonical one, or feature logic placed in a shared module
- A bulk "bump dependencies" PR with no changelog review and no per-package isolation
- A lockfile change that's hand-edited, uncommitted, or merged without reviewing its diff

### Verification

After review is complete:

- [ ] All Critical issues are resolved
- [ ] All Required (no-prefix) changes are resolved or explicitly deferred with justification
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] The verification story is documented (what changed, how it was verified)
- [ ] Dependency upgrades were reviewed against their changelog, isolated per package, and verified by a green suite with the lockfile diff reviewed

**Presumptive blockers:** surface and propose the simpler design for each of these; escalate to Required only when the change actively makes structure worse: a refactor that relocates complexity instead of reducing it; a change that pushes a file past the size boundary with no decomposition; feature logic added to a shared module; a near-duplicate of an existing canonical helper; a silent fallback that hides an unclear invariant.

### Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric                          | Good    | Needs Work | Poor    |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)  | ≤ 2.5s  | ≤ 4.0s     | > 4.0s  |
| INP (Interaction to Next Paint) | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 500ms    | > 500ms |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)   | ≤ 0.1   | ≤ 0.25     | > 0.25  |

### TTFB Diagnosis

When TTFB is slow (> 800ms), check each component in DevTools Network waterfall:

- [ ] **DNS resolution** slow → add `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` or `<link rel="preconnect">` for known origins
- [ ] **TCP/TLS handshake** slow → enable HTTP/2, consider edge deployment, verify keep-alive
- [ ] **Server processing** slow → profile backend, check slow queries, add caching

### Frontend Checklist

#### Images

- [ ] Images use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- [ ] Images are responsively sized (`srcset` and `sizes`)
- [ ] Images and `<source>` elements have explicit `width` and `height` (prevents CLS in art direction)
- [ ] Below-the-fold images use `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`
- [ ] Hero/LCP images use `fetchpriority="high"` and no lazy loading

#### JavaScript

- [ ] Bundle size under 200KB gzipped (initial load)
- [ ] Code splitting with dynamic `import()` for routes and heavy features
- [ ] Tree shaking enabled (verify dependency ships ESM and marks `sideEffects: false`)
- [ ] No blocking JavaScript in `<head>` (use `defer` or `async`)
- [ ] Heavy computation offloaded to Web Workers (if applicable)
- [ ] `React.memo()` on expensive components that re-render with same props
- [ ] `useMemo()` / `useCallback()` only where profiling shows benefit
- [ ] Long tasks (> 50ms) broken up to keep the main thread available — main lever for INP
- [ ] `yieldToMain` pattern used inside long-running loops so input events can run between chunks
- [ ] Modern scheduling APIs used where available: `scheduler.yield()` (preferred), `scheduler.postTask()` with priorities, `isInputPending()` to yield only when needed
- [ ] `requestIdleCallback` for deferrable, non-urgent work (analytics flush, prefetch, warmup)
- [ ] Non-critical work deferred out of event handlers (e.g. analytics, logging) so the response to the interaction is not delayed
- [ ] Third-party scripts loaded with `async` / `defer`, audited for size, and fronted by a facade when heavy (chat widgets, embeds)

#### CSS

- [ ] Critical CSS inlined or preloaded
- [ ] No render-blocking CSS for non-critical styles
- [ ] No CSS-in-JS runtime cost in production (use extraction)

#### Fonts

- [ ] Limited to 2–3 font families, 2–3 weights each (every additional weight is another request)
- [ ] WOFF2 format only (smallest, universal support — skip WOFF/TTF/EOT)
- [ ] Self-hosted when possible (third-party font CDNs add DNS + TCP + TLS round-trips)
- [ ] LCP-critical fonts preloaded: `<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>`
- [ ] `font-display: swap` (or `optional` for non-critical) to avoid FOIT blocking render
- [ ] Subsetted via `unicode-range` to ship only the glyphs each page needs
- [ ] Variable fonts considered when multiple weights/styles are required (one file replaces many)
- [ ] Fallback font metrics adjusted with `size-adjust`, `ascent-override`, `descent-override` to reduce CLS on font swap
- [ ] System font stack considered before any custom font

#### Network

- [ ] Static assets cached with long `max-age` + content hashing
- [ ] API responses cached where appropriate (`Cache-Control`)
- [ ] HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 enabled
- [ ] Resources preconnected (`<link rel="preconnect">`) for known origins
- [ ] `fetchpriority` used on critical non-image resources (e.g., key `<link rel="preload">`, above-the-fold `<script>`) — not only on `<img>`
- [ ] No unnecessary redirects

#### Rendering

- [ ] No layout thrashing (forced synchronous layouts)
- [ ] Animations use `transform` and `opacity` (GPU-accelerated)
- [ ] Long lists use virtualization (e.g., `react-window`)
- [ ] No unnecessary full-page re-renders
- [ ] Off-screen sections use `content-visibility: auto` with `contain-intrinsic-size` to skip layout/paint of non-visible areas
- [ ] No `unload` event handlers and no `Cache-Control: no-store` on HTML responses — preserves back/forward cache (bfcache) eligibility

### Backend Checklist

#### Database

- [ ] No N+1 query patterns (use eager loading / joins)
- [ ] Queries have appropriate indexes
- [ ] List endpoints paginated (never `SELECT * FROM table`)
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Slow query logging enabled

##### Query plans

- [ ] `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` captured **before** the fix, not just after — it is the baseline
- [ ] `Seq Scan` on a large table understood: index missing, unusable, or genuinely not worth it
- [ ] Estimated vs actual `rows=` within an order of magnitude (if not, refresh statistics before touching indexes)
- [ ] No `Sort` node that a composite index could absorb
- [ ] Plan re-checked after the change — an index that did not change the plan gets reverted

##### Index strategy

- [ ] Composite index column order is equality first, then range/sort
- [ ] Index covers the query shape (filter + sort), not just one column in isolation
- [ ] Covering index considered for hot read paths (index-only scan avoids the heap fetch)
- [ ] Not indexing low-selectivity columns _for the dominant value_; a partial index still serves the rare-value query (`WHERE status = 'failed'`)
- [ ] Expression index used where the query applies a function (`lower(email)`)
- [ ] Full-text or trigram index used for leading-wildcard search, not a B-tree
- [ ] Write cost measured on write-heavy tables (every index taxes every `INSERT`/`UPDATE`)
- [ ] Unused and duplicate indexes dropped (they cost writes and buy nothing)

##### Connection pooling

- [ ] One pool per process, not per request or per module
- [ ] `instances × pool max` stays under the database's `max_connections`
- [ ] `connectionTimeoutMillis` set so exhaustion fails fast instead of queueing forever
- [ ] Exhaustion diagnosed before resizing: find what holds connections (long transactions, missing `await`, leaked clients)
- [ ] Serverless / autoscaling fronted by a multiplexing proxy (pgbouncer, RDS Proxy) rather than a larger pool

#### API

- [ ] Response times < 200ms (p95)
- [ ] No synchronous heavy computation in request handlers
- [ ] Bulk operations instead of loops of individual calls
- [ ] Response compression (gzip/brotli)
- [ ] Appropriate caching (in-memory, Redis, CDN)

#### Infrastructure

- [ ] CDN for static assets
- [ ] Server located close to users (or edge deployment)
- [ ] Horizontal scaling configured (if needed)
- [ ] Health check endpoint for load balancer

### Caching Strategies

The decision material (which layer, which invalidation strategy, what never to cache) lives in the `performance-optimization` skill. This section covers the read/write patterns and the checklist.

#### Read and write patterns

| Pattern                       | How it works                                           | Use when                                                    | Watch out for                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cache-aside** (lazy)        | App checks cache, on miss reads origin and populates   | Default choice; read-heavy, tolerant of a cold first hit    | Every miss hits the origin, so it needs stampede protection                          |
| **Read-through**              | Cache layer itself loads on miss                       | You want the load path in one place, not at every call site | Hides origin latency; a slow origin looks like a slow cache                          |
| **Write-through**             | Write goes to cache and origin together, synchronously | Reads must never see a stale value after a write            | Adds cache latency to every write                                                    |
| **Write-behind** (write-back) | Write hits cache, origin updated asynchronously        | Write-heavy, and the origin is the bottleneck               | Data loss window if the cache dies before the flush. Needs durability you can defend |

#### Negative caching

Cache the _absence_ of a result too. A key that misses on every lookup (a nonexistent user ID probed in a loop, a 404 asset) sends every request to the origin, which is a cache that only protects the happy path.

- Store an explicit "not found" sentinel with a **shorter** TTL than positive entries
- Keep the negative TTL short enough that a newly created record appears promptly
- Never let an origin _error_ become a negative cache entry, or one failing minute becomes many

#### Request coalescing (stampede protection)

One recompute, N waiters. Prevents a hot key's expiry from delivering the full concurrent load to the origin:

```typescript
const inFlight = new Map<string, Promise<unknown>>();

function loadOnce<T>(key: string, fetcher: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
	const existing = inFlight.get(key) as Promise<T> | undefined;
	if (existing) return existing;
	const p = fetcher().finally(() => inFlight.delete(key));
	inFlight.set(key, p);
	return p;
}
```

For a shared cache, the same idea needs a distributed lock, or `stale-while-revalidate` so waiters serve the stale value instead of blocking.

#### Cache checklist

- [ ] The cached call was measured as expensive first (caching a fast call adds a hop and buys nothing)
- [ ] Read/write ratio justifies the cache (re-read far more often than written)
- [ ] Cache key includes every input the response varies on: tenant, viewer, locale, permissions, feature flags
- [ ] No per-user data cached under a key that does not identify the user
- [ ] One invalidation strategy chosen (TTL, event/tag, or versioned keys), not an accidental mix
- [ ] Acceptable staleness window written down, not implied by whatever TTL was typed
- [ ] Stampede protection on hot keys (coalescing, lock, or `stale-while-revalidate`)
- [ ] Negative results cached with a shorter TTL; origin errors never cached
- [ ] Eviction policy and memory ceiling set (an unbounded cache is a memory leak)
- [ ] Hit rate monitored — a cache nobody measures is an assumption, and a low hit rate is pure overhead
- [ ] Nothing cached whose staleness is a correctness bug (balances, permissions, inventory at checkout)

### Measurement Commands

#### INP field data and DevTools workflow

1. **Field data first** — check [CrUX Vis](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/vis) or your RUM tool for real-user INP before optimising
2. **Identify slow interactions** — open DevTools → Performance panel → record while interacting; look for long tasks triggered by clicks/keystrokes
3. **Test on mid-range Android** — INP issues often only surface on slower hardware; use a real device or DevTools CPU throttling (4×–6× slowdown)

```bash
# Lighthouse CLI
npx lighthouse https://localhost:3000 --output json --output-path ./report.json

# Bundle analysis
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer stats.json
# or for Vite:
npx vite-bundle-visualizer

# Check bundle size
npx bundlesize

# Web Vitals in code
import { onLCP, onINP, onCLS } from 'web-vitals';
onLCP(console.log);
onINP(console.log);
onCLS(console.log);

# INP with interaction-level detail (attribution build)
import { onINP } from 'web-vitals/attribution';
onINP(({ value, attribution }) => {
  const { interactionTarget, inputDelay, processingDuration, presentationDelay } = attribution;
  console.log({ value, interactionTarget, inputDelay, processingDuration, presentationDelay });
});
```

| Anti-Pattern                      | Impact                                         | Fix                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| N+1 queries                       | Linear DB load growth                          | Use joins, includes, or batch loading                                             |
| Unbounded queries                 | Memory exhaustion, timeouts                    | Always paginate, add LIMIT                                                        |
| Missing indexes                   | Slow reads as data grows                       | Add indexes for filtered/sorted columns                                           |
| Indexing without reading the plan | Write cost paid, read gain unproven            | `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before and after; revert if the plan is unchanged               |
| Redundant / unused indexes        | Every write pays for them                      | Audit usage stats, drop what nothing reads                                        |
| Connection pool per request       | Exhausts `max_connections` under load          | One pool per process; proxy for serverless                                        |
| Cache key missing the viewer      | One user's data served to another              | Key on tenant, viewer, locale, permissions                                        |
| Unbounded cache                   | Memory leak wearing an optimization's clothing | Set eviction policy and a memory ceiling                                          |
| Cache stampede on a hot key       | Origin takes full concurrent load at expiry    | Coalesce misses, or `stale-while-revalidate`                                      |
| Layout thrashing                  | Jank, dropped frames                           | Batch DOM reads, then batch writes                                                |
| Unoptimized images                | Slow LCP, wasted bandwidth                     | Use WebP, responsive sizes, lazy load                                             |
| Large bundles                     | Slow Time to Interactive                       | Code split, tree shake, audit deps                                                |
| Blocking main thread              | Poor INP, unresponsive UI                      | Chunk long tasks with `scheduler.yield()` / `yieldToMain`, offload to Web Workers |
| Memory leaks                      | Growing memory, eventual crash                 | Clean up listeners, intervals, refs                                               |

- [OWASP Top 10 for LLMs Quick Reference](#owasp-top-10-for-llms-quick-reference)

### Threat Modeling (Start Here)

Before reaching for controls, spend five minutes thinking like an attacker:

- [ ] Trust boundaries mapped (requests, uploads, webhooks, third-party APIs, LLM output, and local values written by processes you don't control)
- [ ] Assets named (credentials, PII, payment data, admin actions, money movement)
- [ ] STRIDE run per boundary (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Info disclosure, DoS, Elevation)
- [ ] Abuse cases written next to use cases ("how would I misuse this?")

### Pre-Commit Checks

- [ ] No secrets in code (`git diff --cached | grep -i "password\|secret\|api_key\|token"`)
- [ ] `.gitignore` covers: `.env`, `.env.local`, `*.pem`, `*.key`
- [ ] `.env.example` uses placeholder values (not real secrets)

### Authentication

- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (≥12 rounds), scrypt, or argon2
- [ ] Session cookies: `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite: 'lax'`
- [ ] Session expiration configured (reasonable max-age)
- [ ] Rate limiting on login endpoint (≤10 attempts per 15 minutes)
- [ ] Password reset tokens: time-limited (≤1 hour), single-use
- [ ] Account lockout after repeated failures (optional, with notification)
- [ ] MFA supported for sensitive operations (optional but recommended)

### Authorization

- [ ] Every protected endpoint checks authentication
- [ ] Every resource access checks ownership/role (prevents IDOR)
- [ ] Admin endpoints require admin role verification
- [ ] API keys scoped to minimum necessary permissions
- [ ] JWT tokens validated (signature, expiration, issuer)

### Input Validation

- [ ] All user input validated at system boundaries (API routes, form handlers)
- [ ] Validation uses allowlists (not denylists)
- [ ] String lengths constrained (min/max)
- [ ] Numeric ranges validated
- [ ] Email, URL, and date formats validated with proper libraries
- [ ] File uploads: type restricted, size limited, content verified
- [ ] SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation)
- [ ] HTML output encoded (use framework auto-escaping)
- [ ] URLs validated before redirect (prevent open redirect)
- [ ] Server-side URL fetches allowlisted; private/reserved IPs blocked (prevent SSRF)
- [ ] Destructive path operations (delete/move/overwrite): symlinks resolved, allowlisted root, minimum depth, ownership evidence read before the call

#### Destructive Path Operations

Containment for a target named by data. Resolve first, then decide — and treat the
result as a candidate, not as authorization:

```typescript
import { realpath, readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { resolve, relative, isAbsolute, join, sep } from 'node:path';

const ALLOWED_ROOTS = ['/var/lib/myapp/sessions']; // an allowlist, not a pattern
const MIN_DEPTH = 1; // so a root is never the target

async function resolveDeletable(candidate: string, expectedOwner: string) {
	const target = await realpath(resolve(candidate)); // symlinks resolved BEFORE the check
	const inRoot = ALLOWED_ROOTS.some((root) => {
		const rel = relative(root, target);
		// `rel === '..'` / `'../'` only — a plain `startsWith('..')` would also
		// reject a legitimate child named `..cache`.
		if (rel === '' || rel === '..' || rel.startsWith(`..${sep}`) || isAbsolute(rel)) return false;
		return rel.split(sep).length >= MIN_DEPTH;
	});
	if (!inRoot) throw new Error(`refusing: outside allowed roots (${target})`);

	const owner = await readFile(join(target, '.owner'), 'utf8').catch(() => null);
	if (owner?.trim() !== expectedOwner) throw new Error(`refusing: unproven owner (${target})`);
	return target;
}
```

What this does not do, and must be said where the snippet is copied from:

- **The marker is self-attestation.** Anything that can write inside the root can write
  `.owner`. `expectedOwner` has to come from authenticated state, and the marker needs
  integrity protection (restrictive ownership, or a MAC) before it is authorization
  rather than a consistency check against a misderived target.
- **Returning a path leaves a check/use race.** Where an untrusted process can swap an
  ancestor between the check and the call, operate on a descriptor with no-follow,
  beneath-the-root semantics, or guarantee the hierarchy is immutable for the duration.

### Security Headers

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 0  (disabled, rely on CSP)
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

### CORS Configuration

```typescript
// Restrictive (recommended)
cors({
	origin: ['https://yourdomain.com', 'https://app.yourdomain.com'],
	credentials: true,
	methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE'],
	allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
});

// NEVER use in production:
cors({ origin: '*' }); // Allows any origin
```

### Data Protection

- [ ] Sensitive fields excluded from API responses (`passwordHash`, `resetToken`, etc.)
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged (passwords, tokens, full CC numbers)
- [ ] PII encrypted at rest (if required by regulation)
- [ ] HTTPS for all external communication
- [ ] Database backups encrypted
- [ ] Personal data is classified, collected against a stated purpose, and minimized
- [ ] Personal data has a retention limit and a working deletion path (incl. backups, caches, indexes)
- [ ] Export/delete (data-subject) requests are supported where required; third-party sharing has consent and a data-processing agreement

### Dependency Security

First locate the **installation boundary**. If the package is matched by a parent `workspaces` declaration, use that workspace root; otherwise use the nearest project root that owns both its manifest and dependency graph. At that boundary, corroborate `packageManager` (when present), the lockfile, and CI commands. Stop if they disagree or competing manager lockfiles exist there. A nested project is independent only when it is outside the parent workspace; independent subprojects may legitimately use different managers.

| Manager/version signal                             | Frozen/immutable CI install      | Known-advisory audit   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| npm (`package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json`) | `npm ci`                         | `npm audit`            |
| pnpm                                               | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | `pnpm audit`           |
| Yarn 2+                                            | `yarn install --immutable`       | `yarn npm audit -A -R` |
| Yarn 1                                             | `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` | `yarn audit`           |

For an unlisted manager or version, consult its official documentation; do not substitute another manager's commands or newer defaults.

#### Install-Script Gate

Never discover dependency lifecycle scripts by first executing an ordinary install on a client whose defaults have not been verified.

1. Bootstrap with dependency scripts disabled, or with a documented default-deny policy plus fail-closed enforcement.
2. Inspect the exact script source and package version before approval.
3. Record the narrowest native allow/deny policy at the installation boundary and commit it.
4. Run a clean frozen/immutable install with that policy and verify the required packages still build.

**Point-in-time snapshot:** Package-manager defaults and command names change quickly. Verify this matrix against the pinned client's current official documentation before relying on it.

| Manager version                         | Native policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| npm without verified granular approvals | Bootstrap with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, or persist `ignore-scripts=true` when project-wide blocking is intended. Keep scripts disabled or deliberately upgrade before allowing any reviewed dependency script.                                                       |
| npm 11.18.x (verified on 11.18.0)       | Unreviewed dependency scripts run with a warning by default. Enforce `strict-allow-scripts=true` before a normal install, then use the workspace-unaware `npm install-scripts ls` from the installation boundary; keep approvals version-pinned and denials name-wide. |
| npm 12.x (verified on 12.0.1)           | Unreviewed dependency scripts are skipped by default; `strict-allow-scripts=true` makes their presence fail the install before execution. Use the same `npm install-scripts` review and approval flow.                                                                 |
| pnpm 11+                                | Use `pnpm approve-builds` and commit `allowBuilds` decisions; `strictDepBuilds` defaults to `true`, so unreviewed builds fail.                                                                                                                                         |
| pnpm 10.26–10.x                         | Configure `allowBuilds` explicitly, or use `pnpm approve-builds` with the legacy `onlyBuiltDependencies` / `ignoredBuiltDependencies` lists. Set `strictDepBuilds: true`; its v10 default is `false`.                                                                  |
| pnpm 10.1–10.25                         | `pnpm approve-builds` records the legacy lists; enable `strictDepBuilds` where supported (10.3+).                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Older or unknown pnpm                   | Bootstrap with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`. Keep scripts disabled unless the pinned version documents an enforceable policy.                                                                                                                     |
| Yarn 4.14+                              | Dependency postinstalls are disabled by default. Grant only required exceptions with top-level `dependenciesMeta.<package>.built: true`.                                                                                                                               |
| Yarn 2–4.13                             | Set `enableScripts: false` in `.yarnrc.yml`, then grant only required exceptions with top-level `dependenciesMeta.<package>.built: true`; do not enable scripts globally.                                                                                              |

Authoritative checks: [npm install-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install-scripts/), [install policy](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install/), and [CLI releases](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases); [pnpm approve-builds](https://pnpm.io/cli/approve-builds) and [build settings](https://pnpm.io/settings#allowbuilds); [Yarn security](https://yarnpkg.com/features/security) and [manifest](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#dependenciesMeta).

**Supply-chain hygiene** (advisory audits do not catch newly malicious packages):

- [ ] Exactly one authoritative lockfile per project/workspace root is committed and CI never rewrites it
- [ ] Critical/high findings are triaged for reachability; deferrals have a reason and review date
- [ ] Forced audit remediation (`npm audit fix --force` or equivalent) is never automatic; remediation diffs and changelogs are reviewed
- [ ] Registry signatures/provenance are verified where the manager supports it
- [ ] Dependency lifecycle scripts are blocked before first execution and approved only through the pinned manager's native policy
- [ ] New dependencies are reviewed for ownership, maintenance, release age, provenance, transitive graph, and typosquatting

### AI / LLM Security

For any feature that calls an LLM (chatbots, summarizers, agents, RAG):

- [ ] Model output treated as untrusted — never into `eval`/SQL/shell/`innerHTML`/file paths
- [ ] Prompt injection assumed; permissions enforced in code, not in the system prompt
- [ ] Secrets, cross-tenant data, and full system prompts kept out of the context window
- [ ] Tool/agent permissions scoped; destructive or irreversible actions require confirmation
- [ ] Token, rate, and recursion/loop limits set (bound consumption)

### Error Handling

```typescript
// Production: generic error, no internals
res.status(500).json({
	error: { code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR', message: 'Something went wrong' },
});

// NEVER in production:
res.status(500).json({
	error: err.message,
	stack: err.stack, // Exposes internals
	query: err.sql, // Exposes database details
});
```
